<h2>PhD students</h2>
<ul>

<li><p>Giorgio Micali (supervised by Annika Betken, I am promotor)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Dutch system</h2>
<p>In the Netherlands the right to promote candidates to PhD, called the &lsquo;ius promovendi&rsquo;, is limited to full professors and in some universities as well to a certain subset of associate professors - including me. Each PhD student needs to have at least one such promotor, but they are not necessarily involved in the supervision. This is the case for me with Giorgio: I was not involved in his research projects, but I will guide him in writing the thesis. Those who do not have the ius promovendi, but are involved in the supervision of the PhD candidate are called &lsquo;co-promotor&rsquo;. One can also be called a co-promotor when one does have the ius, was involved in the supervision, but not as main supervisor. This is the case for me with Dante. Lastly, each candidate needs to have at least two (co-)promotores - typically only one of them is involved in the daily supervision, but it happens that both of them are equally involved. This is the case for Aurèle and Rovanos, who are appointed on the M2 project, which is a joint project between Jelle and me.</p>
