<h2>Prospective BSc and MSc thesis projects</h2>
<p>If you are interested in doing a thesis project with me for your BSc or MSc in mathematics, or a related discipline with a strong mathematical component, feel free to drop me an e-mail stating your interests (if they overlap with mine).</p>
<h2>Prospective PhD students</h2>
<p>At the moment I do not have vacancies for PhD students.</p>
<p>We are an inclusive group and diversity is at the heart of our research principles. We care about a good working atmosphere and a good work-life balance. Whenever there is a vacancy, applications from all groups currently under-represented in academic posts are especially encouraged.</p>
<p>If you are interested in doing a PhD with me and you bring your own funding or you are planning to apply for a grant to do so, feel free to contact me, and if I also think it's a good match I can help you with it. It helps to decribe in your e-mail why you think my research interests fit well with yours, and why you think it is a good idea for me to consider you.</p>
<p>Don't send me generic or LLM-generated e-mails. Don't send me e-mails asking whether I have funding to hire you: positions will be advertised here and at my university's website.</p>
<h2>Prospective postdocs</h2>
<p>At the moment I do not have funding for a postdoc position.</p>
<p>If you are interested in doing a postdoc with me, there are many <a href="https://asntech.github.io/postdoc-funding-schemes/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>funding schemes</a> available to obtain your own funding. Contact me if you consider this, and I can help you with the application.</p>
<h2>Visitors</h2>
<p>I'm open to hosting visitors from other universities in the last years of their PhD or postdocs/faculty. I don't have funding for this, so you need to bring your own, but my university can provide you with an office so that you can fully participate in the group. Of course, having research interests similar to mine and bringing relevant knowledge and skills is essential for a mutually beneficial collaboration during the research stay.</p>
